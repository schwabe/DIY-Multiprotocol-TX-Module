# Compliling and Programming (STM32)

**If you are Compling for the Arduino ATmega328p version of the Multiprotocol Module please go to the dedicated [Compiling and Programming ATmega328](Compiling.md) page.**

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
Multiprotocol source can be compiled using the Arduino IDE using STM32 Core (Maple) and Arduino ARM-Cortex-M3 libraries. 
On all modules with STM32F103 microcontroller, the program flash memory on the microcontroller is large enough to accommodate all the protocols.  You do not have to make choices on which protocols to upload.  Also, it is likely that you used the Banggood 4-in-1 RF module and you will therefore have access to all the RF modules.Now for programmng multimodule with STM32 chip  you have 2 options presented below.

1. Compiling and flashing in Arduino IDE.
1. Flashing precompiled binaries from [here](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/releases)
   - If using one of these TX with multimodule like Turnigy 9X,9XR,9X+ the binary file for flashing is **Multiprotocol_V1.X.X_STM32.bin**.
   - If using TARANIS TX the binary file  is **Multiprotocol_V1.X.X_STM32_INV.bin**

Flashing precompiled **binaries** is done very simple with the cable setup presented below and an utility(GUI) **ST Flash Loader Demonstrator.**

## Compiling source and flashing in Arduino.

### Install the Arduino IDE and the Multiprotocol project
1. Download the Arduino IDE. The currently supported Arduino version is 1.6.11 available for [Windows]( https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.12-windows.exe) and [Mac OSX](http://arduino.cc/download_handler.php?f=/arduino-1.6.12-macosx.zip)
1. It is recommended to upgrade Java to the [latest version](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
1. Download the [STM32 Core](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/archive/master.zip) and copy the Arduino_STM32 folder to:
   - OSX: ```Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware```  (you can open Arduino.app by Ctl Clicking on Arduino.app and selecting "Show Package Contents") 
   - Windows: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware``` 
   - Make sure the folder tree structure is like this .....\hardware\Arduino_STM32\.....and **NOT** ...... \hardware\Arduino_STM32-master\Arduino_STM32-master\......So move the folders /rename accordingly.
1. Download the zip file with the Multiprotocol module source code from [here](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module)
1. Unzip and copy the source code folder ```Multiprotocol``` to a folder of your choosing
1. Click on the ```Multiprotocol.ino file``` in the ```Multiprotocol``` folder and the Arduino environment should appear and the Multiprotocol project will be loaded.

### Prepare the Arduino IDE:

1. In order to compile successfully you need also to modify a maple library file. In ```....\hardware\Arduino_STM32\STM32F1\cores\maple\libmaple\usart_f1.c``` comment out the 2 functions as shown below. This is required to have low-level access to the USART interrupt. <br>
   ```
   /* void __irq_usart2(void){
   usart_irq(&usart2_rb, USART2_BASE);
   }
    
   void __irq_usart3(void) {
   usart_irq(&usart3_rb, USART3_BASE);
   } */
   ```
1. Run the IDE, and on the **Tools** menu, select **Board** and then **Boards manager**. <br> Click on the Arduino DUE (32 Bits ARM-Cortex M3) from the list of available boards. You must do this step, it installs the arm-none-eabi-g++ toolchain!
1. Close and reopen the Arduino IDE and load the Multiprotocol project.
1. In arduino IDE under the **Tools** -> **Board:** select the **Generic STM32F103C series** board
1. Click on the **Verify** button to test compile the before you make any changes. <br> If there are any errors check the process above and be sure to have the right version of the Arduino IDE.The binary file generated location is presented at the bottom of Arduino IDE compiling window.Now continue with flashing procedure.


### Flashing the multimodule

There are three options for flashing the firmware. But We will present here only 3 methods ,the 4-th one is presented in advanced topics.
The first (and strongly recommended) is flashing it while it is plugged into and powered by the transmitter.The second is preparing the board for flashing with a USB cable. 
The second  method is definitely the easiest in the long-term, but it does require the USB bord and setting up the bootloader on the STM32 MCU.
The third method is also highly recommended and involving flashing using TX (firmware).At this methid is available for 9X ,9X pro ,Taranis with ersky9X fimrware.

#### Option 1: Flashing with Tx power(highly recommended)

1. Put the module in the Tx 
1. Place a jumper over the BOOT0 pins.Skip this one if you made your own cable for flashing ,see below. 
1. Connect your 3.3V/5V FTDI cable (USB - TTL serial) to  Multiprotocol serial port. <br> Connect only RX, TX and GND.  **Do not connect the 5V or 3.3V between the FTDI cable and the module - the power will be supplied by the transmitter**.  Connect the pins as follows:   
   - Module RX pin to FTDI TX pin
   - Module TX pin to FTDI Rx pin
   - Module GND to FTDI GND 
1. In arduino IDE under the **Tools** -> **Board:** check that you have selected the **Generic STM32F103C series** board 
1. Under **Tools** -> **Upload Method:** select **Serial** 
1. Click "Upload" and the sketch will be uploaded normally.   This is valid for  all arduino versions. 
1. Once the firmware has uploaded, remove the BOOT0 jumper. 

If you have the module inside a box and to be inserted in TX bay, you may build a flashing cable like in the picture below.
You can attach and solder a 5 pin header female and top outside the box.**ALways insert first the USB serial device in USB port , and TX start after.**

#### Option 2: Flashing with USB cable.

This method use USB connector on the STM32 V1.0 board or on the maple clone board.  
1. Install first maple USB driver by running the batch file found in Arduino STM32 package folder ```..\hardware\Arduino_STM32\drivers\win\install_drivers.bat```
1. Download the free STM32 flash loader demonstrator from [ST.com](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html) and using a USB-TTL device (like FTDI cable) flash the STM32duino bootloader available from Roger Clark's great STM32 site [here](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader/tree/master/STM32F1/binaries) .Use bootloader **generic_boot20_pa1.bin**
1. Open Arduino IDE,browse to multiprotocol folder,load the sketch multiprotocol.ino.Select the serial COM port(see notes below)
1. In Arduino IDE under "Upload method" select **STM32duino**-bootloader.Click upload ,wait until upload is complete.

Notes:
- When you use multiSTM32_USB for the first time,the USB drivers are not recognized and com port is not open/recognized(arduino IDE port selection is grey/unavailable). After this first time use, any subsequent update of the program, you'll have to select the correct serial port and  upload sketches normally in Arduino using USB port.
- More  explanations how all these work you find [here](http://www.stm32duino.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=1774_)
- If the initial upload fails, make sure you are running the latest [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- If using Banggood  multiSTM32_USB module, follow instructions from step1(USB drivers on your computer) and jump after, to step 3(most probably generic bootloader is installed on multi module and no need to be installed again).I don't have one for test so this is an educated guess.

#### Option 3: Flashing with TX radio(firmware)
1. Flash new STM32 bootloader(StmBoot) on multimodule.You have 2 options here.You can use one or the other.

- Flash precompiled binary **StmBoot.ino.generic_stm32f103c** using **ST Flash loader demonstrator** and  USB serial device(FTDI) , with same custom cable presented above.This process is the same as flashing with precompiled binaries.For BG(green) module you can folow the paper instructions for flashing coming with the module using bridge pins  provided.
- Or you can compile Stmboot files yourself ,**Stmboot.ino** file using arduino IDE ,select Tools ,Upload method : **"Serial"** and press upload button.All this setup is  using the same custom cable and USB-serial device(FTDI) as before.
- After this process is complete switch off TX,remove cables FTDI serila device and/or mutimodule jumper used for flashing.The multimodule should be back inthe same state as before.

1. Compile multiprotocol source in arduino IDE ,choose this time Upload method **STM32duino bootloader** ,select **"Export compiled Binary"** to show the binary file in the same folder as source.
1. Take copy of the resulted binary file, to TX radio SD card ,the firmware folder.
1. Now flash the TX radio  with the last firmware(for ersky9x is version P221 "e2" test version or higher).
1. Enter in TX radio maintenance mode(for ersky9X start TX radio with both bottom trims pushed outwards).Select **Update multi** press menu button select also the right com port,update ,then the multiprotocol.bin file (see the correct name) and press menu and again  for flashing. You'll see a bar fill slowly .Wait for the procces to be complete.Press exit( or switch off TX) several times to come out of the maintenace mode.
1. Any subsequent update of the multiprotocol will follow 2-3 and 5-6 steps.There is no need anymore USB serial device or cables for flashing.

## Flashing precompiled binaries: 

If you want to flash a pre-compiled binary file (like the Release .bin files) you need specialized software and the same FTDI cable setup already posted [here](Compiling_STM32.md#option-1-flashing-with-tx-powerhighly-recommended).  

1. Set BOOT0 jumper(skip this step if you aready made  your own cable ,see above)  
1. Connect your 3.3V FTDI cable (USB - TTL serial) to  Multiprotocol serial port (RX,TX,GND pins when flashing with TX power).
1. Insert first FTDI serial to USB port.Start TX (only if using flashing with TX power method)
1. The other steps regarding power supply the same as previous recommandation regarding jumpers  

For uploading binaries(.bin files) there is a specialized software you need to install on your computer.  

#### Windows:
Download the **ST Flash Loader Demonstrator** from here: http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/flasher-stm32.html

Run the ST Flash Loader program. There are many tutorials on the web on how to use this program.For example: [here](http://www.scienceprog.com/flashing-programs-to-stm32-embedded-bootloader)

#### OSX:
To be checked.
